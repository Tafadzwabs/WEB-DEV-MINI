To use this code, download the repository and open the HTML files in a web browser. The CSS file is linked in each HTML file, so there is no need to download additional files.

To customize the website, modify the HTML and CSS files as needed. The CSS file includes styles for the header, hero, services, portfolio, and CTA sections, as well as the navigation bar and buttons.
